    "John Tukey wrote in [Exploratory Data Analysis, 1977](http://www.amazon.com/Exploratory-Data-Analysis-Wilder-Tukey/dp/0201076160/ref=pd_bbs_sr_2/103-4466654-5303007?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1189739816&sr=8-2): \"The greatest value of a picture is when it forces us to notice what we never expected to see.\" In this assignment we will continue using our exploratory data analysis tools, but apply it to new sets of data: [gene expression](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression) and polls from the [2012 Presidental Election](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_2012) and from the [2014 Senate Midterm Elections](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_elections,_2014).   \n",
    "\n",
    "**First**: You will use exploratory data analysis and apply the [singular value decomposition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition) (SVD) to a gene expression data matrix to determine if the the date that the gene expression samples are processed has large effect on the variability seen in the data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Second**: You will use the polls from the 2012 Presidential Elections to determine (1) Is there a pollster bias in presidential election polls? and (2) Is the average of polls better than just one poll?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Finally**: You will use the [HuffPost Pollster API](http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/api) to extract the polls for the current 2014 Senate Midterm Elections and provide a preliminary prediction of the result of each state.\n",
